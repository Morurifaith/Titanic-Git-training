# Titanic-Git-training
Here are the steps to create an ML project using the Titanic dataset:

1. Data Loading and Exploration
Load the dataset (commonly available in CSV format) using Pandas.
Explore the data to understand its structure, missing values, and the types of features available.
2. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values: Impute missing data or remove rows/columns with missing values.
Convert categorical variables to numerical representation (e.g., one-hot encoding for 'sex' or 'embarked' columns).
Feature engineering: Create new features or extract useful information from existing ones if needed.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Choose a Model and Train
Select a suitable ML algorithm (e.g., decision trees, random forests, logistic regression) based on the problem (classification in this case).
Train the model using the training dataset.
4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing dataset using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
Tune hyperparameters to improve model performance (e.g., using cross-validation or grid search).
5. Predictions
Use the trained model to make predictions on new data or the testing dataset.
Evaluate the predictions and analyze the model's behavior.
